Research Problem
One of the challenges for indoor navigation is creating a live map of the area to keep
track of obstacles and items located within the area. Typically SLAM (Simultaneous
location and mapping)1 is used to map a space as operators navigate it. Our objective is
to improve this process by using a combination of stationary ultra wideband sensors
placed around impassable objects and RFID identifiers to track objects for the items that
would be navigated to. The data from these sensors would be edge nodes to process
the mapping for each node individually. These maps would be sent to a central device
to combine them into one continuous map. While other solutions have used edge nodes
for processing SLAM maps, we intend to investigate if our unique inclusion of stationary
sensors combined with edge processing can improve processing time for mapping.


Proposed Solution
Our solution involves a series of ultra wideband sensors set at the boundaries of
impassable objects in a warehouse to keep track of the borders for navigation. This
would be combined with a set of RFID receivers to track the number and location of
objects within the warehouse. Each row would then be processed by an edge node to
create an individual map of those sections and would be sent to a main base node to be
combined into a single map of the warehouse. While other solutions may have used
edge nodes for mapping, they have included pre constructed mapping2. This solution
would be unique in using stationary sensors to reduce cost and improve the processing
efficiency of the map by computing data at the edge nodes individually.
