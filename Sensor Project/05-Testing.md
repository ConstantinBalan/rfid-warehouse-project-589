# Testing

## Testing Environment Setup
- [ ] Design physical testing space to simulate warehouse environment
- [ ] Set up obstacle course with various fixed and movable objects
- [ ] Create controlled testing scenarios for reproducible results
- [ ] Implement automated testing tools where possible
- [ ] Document testing environment specifications

## Unit Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for all sensor interface code
- [ ] Develop tests for mapping algorithms
- [ ] Implement validation tests for data transmission
- [ ] Create test cases for edge processing components
- [ ] Develop unit tests for central node algorithms

## Integration Testing
- [ ] Test communication between sensors and edge nodes
- [ ] Validate data flow from edge nodes to central node
- [ ] Test system recovery after simulated failures
- [ ] Perform load testing with multiple simultaneous objects
- [ ] Validate map accuracy against ground truth measurements

## System Testing
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end system tests in simulated warehouse
- [ ] Measure and validate processing time improvements
- [ ] Test system with various obstacle configurations
- [ ] Validate map creation accuracy and consistency
- [ ] Document system limitations and edge cases
