# UWB-RFID Indoor Positioning System - Agile Development Plan

This directory contains the detailed Agile development plan for the UWB-RFID indoor positioning system project, focusing on tasks that can be completed while waiting for physical hardware.

## Sprint Overview

* **[Sprint 1: Simulation Environment Setup](./sprint1_simulation_environment.md)** - Creating virtual warehouse, pallets, and simulated sensors
* **[Sprint 2: Core Algorithm Testing](./sprint2_core_algorithms.md)** - Benchmarking and implementing positioning algorithms
* **[Sprint 3: Software Infrastructure Setup](./sprint3_infrastructure_setup.md)** - Setting up InfluxDB, MQTT, and Grafana
* **[Sprint 4: System Integration and Testing](./sprint4_integration_testing.md)** - Connecting simulation to real components and testing
* **[Sprint 5: Documentation and Research](./sprint5_documentation_research.md)** - Creating documentation and preparing research materials

## Project Backlog

Future items that may be addressed in later sprints are documented in [Project Backlog](./project_backlog.md).

## Getting Started

Each sprint file contains detailed tasks broken down into user stories with specific implementation details. Progress can be tracked by marking tasks as complete within each sprint file.
